          <h2>Offical Appreciation Letter from KAUST Academy</h2>
          <p>
            During my PhD I have had many opportunities to collaborate with my supervisor in mentoring master's and undergraduate students. 
            One of the experiences I am most proud of was the 2025 UCL–KAUST summer exchange program, where I assisted a high-school student 
            from Saudi Arabia with her first electrochemistry project. We began almost from zero, but through discussions and experiments 
            she quickly grew in confidence and made remarkable progress. In the final poster competition she won third prize against many 
            undergraduate and postgraduate participants, and I received a letter of appreciation from KAUST — the first official letter of 
            thanks in my life, which means a great deal to me.

          <h2>Running, Marathons, and Team Spirit</h2>
          <p>
            I started long-distance running in my first year as an undergraduate and joined the
            track-and-field team of the School of Physics at Lanzhou University. Over the years I
            have taken part in more than twenty half-marathons and marathons, enjoying both the
            discipline and the sense of community that running brings. The photo was taken in 2021
            when I represented the School of Materials in a university long-distance race and helped
            our school win an award.

          <h2>Outstanding Oral Presentation at ICAFPM 2025</h2>
          <p>
            I have been fortunate to receive strong support from my supervisor and to attend many
            academic conferences together, where we present our latest results. In 2025 I delivered
            a talk at the large international forum ICAFPM, hosted by Donghua University,
            introducing our work on using X-ray computed tomography (CT) to study electrochemical
            systems. The presentation received the Outstanding Oral Presentation Award, which greatly
            encouraged me to push my research further and to share our ideas with more confidence.
